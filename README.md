## Sempie's PoE tools

This is an electron / react / vite app with some tools that I enjoy.<br />
Follows the PoE third-party guidelines as much as I can.<br />
This tool only reads the Client.txt log file.

## Inspirations

This tool was inspired by [Lailloken-UI](https://github.com/Lailloken/Lailloken-UI).<br />
However, since I run on Linux, I cannot run his tool.<br />
This app is for those who don't want to run AutoHotkey or can't because they play on Linux / MacOS.
